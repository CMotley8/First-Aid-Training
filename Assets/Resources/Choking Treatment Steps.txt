Check to see if the person has their hands around their neck. If they are coughing then you do not need to perform the Heimlich maneuver.
Stand behind the person and make a fist with your thumb pointed towards you. Place your fist between their belly button and rib cage.
Grab your fist with your other hand and quickly pull back and up until the object is expelled or the person loses consciousness.
