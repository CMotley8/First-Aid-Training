Assess for any signs of movement or signs of normal breathing.
Call 911 or tell someone nearby to call 911.
Place your dominant hand directly on the center of the person's chest and interlock the fingers of your other hand.
Keep your arms straight and lean over the victim, using your body to compress the chest. Push hard and allow the chest to completely recoil after each compression. You should do two compressions per second.
 
 While performing chest compressions, tell someone nearby to get an AED. Turn on the AED and follow the voice-guided directions.
