[```BackButton```](https://github.com/CMotley8/First-Aid-Training/blob/d1d3a9e8d2c5cebfae482eee766b5b282edbddc4/Assets/Scripts/Menu%20Button%20Scripts/BackButton.cs) will hide the ```Select Treatment Buttons``` and display the ```Initial Buttons``` once the player's hand leaves the collider (mimicking being able to hold down a button).

***

The following variables must be adjusted in the inspector in Unity.
- ```initialButtons```, the ```GameObject``` named ```Initial Buttons``` in the scene.
- ```treatmentTypeButtons```, the ```GameObject``` named ```Select Treatment Buttons``` in the scene.
